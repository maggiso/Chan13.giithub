   <h1><b> About Me</b></h1>

   <p>I am an aspiring <em>full-stack developer</em> living in Kakuma, with a passion for creating innovative digital solutions that solve real-world problems. My journey into the world of technology began with a curiosity for how websites and applications function, driving me to explore both front-end and back-end development.</p>
    
   <p>I have honed my skills in languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I am continually expanding my knowledge to include modern technologies like React, Node.js, and databases like MongoDB and MySQL. My experience involves building responsive web applications, crafting user-friendly interfaces, and working with APIs to deliver seamless user experiences.</p>
    
    <p>Living in Kakuma has given me a unique perspective on the transformative power of technology. I am driven to leverage my skills to create solutions that address community challenges and provide access to information and services. My interests extend to open-source projects, collaborative coding, and using technology as a tool for positive social impact.</p>
    
    <p>I am eager to grow as a developer, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to projects that make a difference. With a commitment to lifelong learning, I strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices in software development.</p>
    
    <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy participating in tech communities, sharing knowledge, and mentoring others who are beginning their tech journey. My goal is to become a skilled, adaptable full-stack developer capable of building robust, scalable applications that drive meaningful change.</p>
