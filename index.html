                            It’s essentially the collection of technologies that work together to support the full lifecycle of an application, from development to deployment. A typical tech stack can include:  </P>

        <h3>Web Application</h3>
        <p>A <b>web application</b> is a software application that runs on a web server and is accessed by users through a web browser, rather than being installed locally on a device like traditional desktop applications. Web applications rely on the internet and require a web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) to interact with them.</p>
