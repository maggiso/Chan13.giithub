                <P>A <b>technology stack</b> (often referred to as a <b>tech stack</b>) is a combination of software tools, programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and other technologies used together to develop, deploy, and run applications or systems.

                 It’s essentially the collection of technologies that work together to support the full lifecycle of an application, from development to deployment. A typical tech stack can include:  </P>

      <h3>Web Application</h3>
       <p>A <b>web application</b> is a software application that runs on a web server and is accessed by users through a web browser, rather than being installed locally on a device like traditional desktop applications. Web applications rely on the internet and require a web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) to interact with them.</p>
